    `<p>Rather than chasing trends, the focus is on aligning the work to business goals, clear ownership, and simple execution steps that compound over time.</p>`,
    `<h2>Start with the outcome</h2>`,
    `<p>Before tactics, define the business outcome you need and the behavior that signals success. This prevents the plan from turning into a checklist with no impact.</p>`,
    `<p>Write the outcome in plain language, then align the scope and timeline to it. When the goal is clear, prioritization becomes straightforward.</p>`,
    `<h2>Scope the first sprint</h2>`,
    `<p>Long-form initiatives still need a tight first sprint. Use it to validate the direction, remove unclear assumptions, and ship a version that can be measured.</p>`,
    `<ol>
      <li>Define the single most important metric to improve.</li>
      <li>Map the user journey and pick the highest-leverage step.</li>
      <li>Ship the smallest version that proves the direction works.</li>
    </ol>`,
    `<h2>Build the supporting system</h2>`,
    `<p>Great execution requires a supporting system: documentation, ownership, and feedback loops. This is where most teams lose momentum.</p>`,
    `<p>Assign a single owner, define how updates are communicated, and set a weekly cadence for reviewing results and removing blockers.</p>`,
    `<h3>Checklist for consistency</h3>`,
    `<ul>
      <li>One owner who publishes progress each week.</li>
      <li>A short backlog tied directly to the goal.</li>
      <li>Clear definitions for what is in or out of scope.</li>
      <li>Metrics reviewed on a fixed schedule.</li>
    </ul>`,
    `<h2>Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>`,
    `<p>The biggest pitfall is over-scoping early. Another is optimizing for vanity metrics that do not move the business forward.</p>`,
    `<p>Keep feedback loops tight and remove work that does not show a measurable lift. Focused momentum beats scattered activity.</p>`,
    `<blockquote>Progress compounds when the team can explain what they are building, why it matters, and how it is measured.</blockquote>`,
    `<h2>How to keep momentum</h2>`,
    `<p>Once the initial results are in, expand the work by doubling down on what performed best. Avoid adding new channels or tactics without evidence.</p>`,
    `<p>Document learnings and turn them into standards so the next sprint starts stronger than the last.</p>`,
    `<h2>Next actions</h2>`,
    `<p>Summarize the top three decisions you made, the metric you will move, and the first shipment date. Then align the team and execute.</p>`,
    `<p>If the work stays focused on the outcome, ${safeTitle.toLowerCase()} becomes a repeatable playbook instead of a one-off effort.</p>`
